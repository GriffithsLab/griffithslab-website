## Graduate 

We do not have any funded graduate student positions for the coming academic year. Students and post-docs interested in collaborative projects feel free to get in touch to discuss.



## Undergraduate Students

Undergraduate students interested in computational modelling work, experimental work in the TMS-EEG-fNIRS lab, or [ideally] both, contact Dr. Griffiths at john.griffiths@utoronto.ca, including your current university transcript showing grades and relevant coursework, and a few sentences that outline your interest in joining the lab.
