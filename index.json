This question finds sharp relief in the case of TMS-EEG evoked potentials (TEPs). TEPs are spatiotemporal waveform patterns with characteristic inflections at ∼50ms, ∼100ms, and ∼150-200ms following a single TMS pulse that disperse from, and later reconverge to, the primary stimulated regions. What parts of the TEP are due to recurrent activity? And what light might this shed on more general principles of brain organization? We studied this using source-localized TMS-EEG analyses and whole-brain connectome-based computational modelling. Results indicated that recurrent network feedback begins to drive TEP responses from ∼100ms post-stimulation, with earlier TEP components being attributable to local reverberatory activity within the stimulated region. Subject-specific estimation of neurophysiological parameters additionally indicated an important role for inhibitory GABAergic neural populations in scaling cortical excitability levels, as reflected in TEP waveform characteristics.","tags":["brain stimulation","brain networks"],"title":"TMS-Evoked Responses Are Driven by Recurrent Large-Scale Network Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"5180828ca91b213cdba831677fe44b1f","permalink":"/code_and_software/whobpyt/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/code_and_software/whobpyt/","section":"code_and_software","summary":"","tags":["Software_Libraries","Featured"],"title":"WhoBPyT","type":"code_and_software"},{"authors":["John D.

Estimating physiological parameters by fitting these models to empirical data is challenging however, due to large network sizes, often physiologically detailed fast-timescale system equations, and the need for long (e.g. tens of minutes) simulation runs. Here we introduce a novel approach to connectome-based neural mass model parameter estimation by employing optimization tools developed for deep learning. We cast the system of differential equations representing both neural and haemodynamic activity dynamics as a deep neural network, implemented within a widely used machine learning programming environment (PyTorch). This allows us to use robust industry-standard optimization algorithms, automatic differentiation for computation of gradients, and other useful functionality. The approach is demonstrated using a connectome-based network with nodal dynamics specified by the two-state RWW mean-field neural mass model equations, which we use here as a model of fMRI-measured activity and correlation fluctuations. Additional optimization constraints are explored and prove fruitful, including restricting the model to domains of parameter space near a bifurcation point that yield metastable dynamics. Using these techniques, we first show robust recovery of physiological model parameters in synthetic data and then, as a proof-of-principle, apply the framework to modelling of empirical resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project database. For resting state activity, the system can be understood as a deep net that receives uncorrelated noise on its input layer, which is transformed into network-wide modelled functional connectivity on its output layer. This is consistent with the prevailing conception in theoretical neuroscience of resting-state functional connectivity patterns as an emergent phenomenon that is driven by (effectively) random activity fluctuations, which are then in turn spatiotemporally filtered by anatomical connectivity and local neural dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"Deep-learning based parameter estimation for neurophysiological models of neuroimaging data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shreyas Harita","Davide Momi","Frank Mazza","John D.

The effects of TMS on both brain physiology and therapeutic outcomes are known to be highly variable from subject to subject, however. Proposed reasons for this variability include individual differences in neurophysiology, in cortical geometry, and in brain connectivity. Standard approaches to TMS target site definition tend to focus on coordinates or landmarks within the individual brain regions implicated in MDD, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Additionally considering the network connectivity of these sites (i.e., the wider set of brain regions that may be mono- or poly-synaptically activated by TMS stimulation) has the potential to improve subject-specificity of TMS targeting and, in turn, improve treatment outcomes. In this study, we looked at the functional connectivity (FC) of dlPFC and OFC TMS targets, based on induced electrical field (E-field) maps, estimated using the SimNIBS library. We hypothesized that individual differences in spontaneous functional brain dynamics would contribute more to downstream network engagement than individual differences in cortical geometry (i.e., E-field variability). We generated individualized E-field maps on the cortical surface for 121 subjects (67 female) from the Human Connectome Project database using tetrahedral head models generated from T1- and T2-weighted MR images. F3 and Fp1 electrode positions were used to target the left dlPFC and left OFC, respectively. We analyzed inter-subject variability in the shape and location of these TMS target E-field patterns, their FC, and the major functional networks to which they belong. Our results revealed the key differences in TMS target FC between the dlPFC and OFC, and also how this connectivity varies across subjects. Three major functional networks were targeted across the dlPFC and OFC: the ventral attention, fronto-parietal and default-mode networks in the dlPFC, and the fronto-parietal and default mode networks in the OFC. Inter-subject variability in cortical geometry and in FC was high. Our analyses showed that the use of normative neuroimaging reference data (group-average or representative FC and subject E-field) allows prediction of which networks are targeted, but fails to accurately quantify the relative loading of TMS targeting on each of the principal networks. Our results characterize the FC patterns of canonical therapeutic TMS targets, and the key dimensions of their variability across subjects. The high inter-individual variability in cortical geometry and FC, leading to high variability in distributions of targeted brain networks, may account for the high levels of variability in physiological and therapeutic TMS outcomes. These insights should, we hope, prove useful as part of the broader effort by the psychiatry, neurology, and neuroimaging communities to help improve and refine TMS therapy, through a better understanding of the technology and its neurophysiological effects.","tags":[],"title":"Mapping inter-individual functional connectivity variability in TMS targets for major depressive disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John D.

At large spatial scales such as those studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mechanisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state- (e.g., idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity. We find that increasing the level of sensory drive to the thalamus triggers a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops, and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intracolumnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent frequencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at state-and frequency-specific control of oscillatory brain activity.","tags":[],"title":"A connectome-based, corticothalamic model of state- and stimulation-dependent modulation of rhythmic neural activity and connectivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer D Ryan","Kelly Shen","Arber Kacollja","Heather Tian","John D.

Hats off to the BrainhackTO working group, who put several months of moderately hard work into making last week\u0026rsquo;s workshop happen. As always (well, since the first BrainhackTO in 2016) the charge was led by the working group\u0026rsquo;s benevolent dictator - breaker of bugs, queen of the container and mother of surfaces, Dr. Erin Dickie. The very strong supporting cast included Gabi Herman, Jerry Jaychandra, Natalie Ford, Chris Hammill, Nathan Chan, Derek Beaton, Michael Joseph, Amanda Aesson, Shreejoy Tripathy, Ben Darwin, and Myself.\nThe #BrainHackTO organizers are working hard to organize the best educational opportunities (and snacks) for the big day.

Organizer Russ Poldrack succeeded in securing a very smart and capable list of attendees, including Petra Ritter, Tal Yarkoni, Randy McIntosh, Brad Love, Jonathan Cohen, Marmaduke Woodman, Tim Rogers, Rosalyn Moran, Chris Markiewicz, Padraig Gleeson, and many others.\nThe basic objectives were twofold. First, to identify the types of neuroimaging data commonly used in computational modelling of various flavours, and start work in developing a common vocabulary and file/folder nomenclature for them. This was largely based on several of the existing BIDS derivatives specs, such as connectivity, electrophysiology, bold fmri, etc. The second aim of the discussions was a little more ambitious - namely to find a generic model description that encompasses as many currently used computational modelling approaches as possible.\nIt was a fairly productive few days, with concrete products including a 15 page BIDS extension proposal, outline BIDS apps for neural mass modelling with The Virtual Brain and Dynamic Causal Modelling, and for Bayesian visual fMRI DDM models.\nMost of the work for these projects is of course still ahead, but all in all I think this was an excellent start. Hats off to Russ et al for and pulling together the contributors and pushing forward these important developments in the neuroinformatics of neuroimaging and computational neuroscience.\n","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554681600,"objectID":"ffdae5b58b940b20942c0bca0821c15c","permalink":"/post/bids_compmodels_mtg/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bids_compmodels_mtg/","section":"post","summary":"BIDS-Compmodels worshop - Princeton","tags":null,"title":"Towards standardization of computational models in neuroimaging","type":"post"},{"authors":["John D.

As a result of this, many of the challenges and opportunities involved in developing clinical tools from basic neuroscience knowledge come down to questions about control of dynamic, oscillatory networks. In this chapter we review a range of experimental and theoretical work on control of neural oscillations, in healthy brains and in relation to various clinical conditions. We highlight the main types of qualitative system behaviour that can result from application of periodic stimulation and present a simple case study on this using a mathematical model of rhythmogenesis in thalamocortical circuits. The concepts discussed here may, we hope, help provide some guidelines and principles for the development of future generations of more physiologically and dynamically informed brain stimulation techniques, paradigms,and researchers.","tags":[],"title":"Shaping brain rhythms: dynamic and control-theoretic perspectives on periodic brain stimulation for treatment of neurological disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John"],"categories":null,"content":"After several months\u0026rsquo; lead-in and build-up, I\u0026rsquo;m delighted to announce that the KCNI WBMG / GriffLab is now officially \u0026lsquo;open for business\u0026rsquo;. Recruitment is now getting underway for post-docs, graduate students, and undergrads (see here for more details). This ramp-up phase is being done in parallel with the KCNI computational genomics (triplab) and microcircuit modelling (haylab) groups, and there will be a lots of ideas, skills, and research exchange between our three teams in the coming months and years. A big buzz right now amongst the various KCNI teams (which currently is numbering around 20 people, and will probably double in the next year or two) is our transition in a few weeks over to the fancy new open-plan space on the top floor of 250 college street. In addition to the stunning view of Toronto this will feature a lot of cool tech, and a very modern \u0026lsquo;team-science\u0026rsquo; office culture. I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing more about this here soon. Apart from the inevitable admin barrage of starting a new job, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of exciting things happening at the moment. I outlined some of the plans and progress to date for the KCNI WBMG in my talk at the CAMH Campbell symposium 2 weeks ago. Much of this is given in summary form in the sections of this site, and will of course be expanded on in due course. With my colleagues at NeurotechTO we are co-organizing a workshop in March with OBI and INCF, aimed at developing exchange between academic research and private companies in the neurotech sector. With KCNI colleagues we are organizing a BrainHack in April as a satellite event ahead of the Canadian Neuroscience Association annual meeting, which is in Toronto this year. A few invitations have come in to exciting meetings on neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience later in the year in cool places like Princeton and Barcelona, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure will be very productive.

We use mathematical models describing neural population activity on the scale of millimetres to centimetres, together with network structure from macaque histology or diffusion MRI fibre tracking, to simulate (approximately) whole-brain activity measurements of the kind measured by fMRI and M/EEG. These techniques are gradually allowing us to obtain more mechanistic insights into observed patterns in neuroimaging data relating to the resting state, oscillations, and the impact of neurological and neurodegenerative disease. Much of our work in this area is done collaboratively with colleagues in the Virtual Brain, Human Brain, and Blue Brain Projects.\nA specific area on which we are focusing is the generation and modulation of fast-timescale brain rhythms, as measured noninvasively by MEG and EEG.\nTogether with Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre of the Sync Lab at the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; Krembil Research Institute (UHN Toronto Western Hospital), we have studied how low-frequency rhythms generated by delayed recurrent inhibition in thalamocortical loops interact with higher-frequency rhythms generated by intracolumnar excitatory-inhibitory interactions.\nWe find that a thalamocortical loop motif consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neuronal populations, and excitatory (relay) and inhibitory (reticular) thalamic nuclei, can reproduce a large amount of the empirical pheonomena measured with resting state M/EEG. We are now investigating how the topological structure of the cortex interacts with the rhythmogenic properties of this base circuit motif.\nA different line of work, done together with Prof. Peter Robinson and colleagues at the University of Sydney, focuses on macroscopic neural field models for large-scale brain dynamics. These are generally formulated in terms of second-order partial differential (wave) equations that are substantially simpler to work with analytically than the stochastic delay-differential equation numerically integrated in TVB simulations. In particular, we have studied the role of the spherical topology and physical embedding of the cerebral cortex on anatomical structure and dynamics.\nThis, together with the steady-state eigenmode solutions to the Robinson neural field equations, predicts the presence of spherical harmonic-like patterns in fast-timescale activity measurements. Consistent with this, we have recently shown that this spherical harmonic-like spatial eigenmode structure is observed in cortical surface Laplacians, anatomical connectivity (tractography) networks, (MEG) functional connectivity networks, and numerical simulations. These results provide new insight into the role of the network topology and geometric embedding of the cerebral hemispheres in shaping brain dynamics, as well as the theoretical and practical utility of macroscopic neural field models with spherical boundary conditions.\n","date":1546473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546473600,"objectID":"526d41857bbcfbc10b5139b48d5bb459","permalink":"/project/secondary_areas/models_of_brain_dynamics/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/secondary_areas/models_of_brain_dynamics/","section":"project","summary":"A main overarching theme of most of the work we do in the WBMG is meso/macroscopic computational models of neural dynamics.

So feel free to use it and consider it as such, and I would be very happy if it is also helpful in that regard.\nWhy was I referred to this link? You may have been referred to this page either prior to or following an initial enquiry / expression of interest to me (JG) or another team member.\nIf it was following an initial enquiry e-mail then this is most likely because you did not include the information that we need to properly evaluate you expression of interest.\nIt is unfortunately often not practicable to provide personalized summaries to individuals of what from the below info is specifically relevant to them.

Happily for you, a significant proportion of these unfortunately not very good ones.\nThe not-so-good ones are likely for two main reasons:\na) Very generic cookie-cutter e-mails that have probably been sent out to a large number of recipients indiscrimantly (or, worse, just look like they have)\nb) The applicant (you) did not know what was needed / expected / optimal in the initial application / expression of interest.\nIt is hard to tell what the proportions are for these two, and they are of course not mutually exclusive and probably occur in combination. However these notes are mainly intended to help people who (have done or otherwise would) fall into category b).\nIn both cases the basic problem is that you have not said enough about why you are interested in this lab, and what it is about the specific work that we do that you would like to learn more about and contribute to.\nAt this stage I am less interested in your full bio and life story (impressive as it may be) than that you have the intelligence and perspicacity to spend some time doing the background research and formulating a concise and thoughtful message about how working with us takes you takes you forward in your career goals and intellectual interests, and what you can bring to the table.\nSo what does make a good initial application enquiry ?  3-4 paragraphs At least one paragraph on specic things about our work that interests you, referring to specific papers you have read Include your CV Include dates If you have been recommended to reach out by someone in particular, say so.

He completed his undergraduate training in psychology and philosophy at the University of Warwick, and graduate training in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience at the University of York (advisor Prof. Gary Green) and University of Cambridge (advisor Prof. Lorraine Tyler). He then worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Sydney School of Physics (with Prof. Peter Robinson), and then at the Rotman Research Institute (with Dr. Randy McIntosh) and Krembil Research Institute (with Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre) in Toronto, Canada. He joined the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH and the University of Toronto as a Scientist and Assistant Professor in January 2019.\nDr. Griffiths has a strong technical expertise in multimodal neuroimaging data analysis, scientific computing, and numerical simulations of large-scale brain dynamics. Through his work with Dr. Mcintosh and colleagues in Europe and the US, he is an active contributor to the scientific, software development, and educational missions of the Virtual Brain Project.\nDr. Davide Momi Post-Doctoral Fellow\n Research Interests:\nDavide completed his Ph.D. at the Department of Neuroscience, Imaging and Clinical Sciences at the University G. d\u0026rsquo;Annunzio of Chieti. As part of his PhD, Davide attended a period abroad as a visiting PhD student at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Boston. Prior to his doctoral studies, he obtained a Master’s degree in Neurosciences and Neuro-Psychological Rehabilitation from the University of Bologna and a Bachelor’s in psychology from the University of Perugia. Davide has experience with multimodal neuroimaging data (e.g. DWI, fMRI, ASL) analysis, TMS applications, EEG data collection and analysis, quantitative structural MRI assessment (e.g. brain morphometry, cortical thickness, etc.), machine learning, cognitive tasks development with a growing passion for simulations of network-level macroscale brain dynamics. His main interest is focused on predicting the TMS signal propagation at the network-level, based on neuroimaging and electrophysiological data. At the WBMG, Davide will be working on several projects which will involve multimodal neuroimaging, non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS, TES) and whole-brain modelling. The primary aim of his project is to predict TMS outcomes by combining computational, neuroimaging and electrophysiological approaches.\nTrivia about Davide:\nAs a proud Italian, Davide never forgets to renew his membership for the “fighting against pineapple on pizza” (a.k.a. Hawaiian pizza) movement. He conducts a healthy lifestyle. He goes to the gym; he likes to hike and go for walks surrounded by nature. Davide is an enthusiastic basketball fan and he used to play semi-pro in the past. He is 6 ft 6 in. tall and is gradually getting used to his height.\nShreyas Harita Ph.D. Student\n Research Interests:\nShreyas is a Ph.D. student who joined the lab as a Research Trainee in May, 2019. His research interests lie in the use of connectome based neural mass modeling to study neural population activity, and how it changes in response to brain stimulation and in neuropathological conditions. The primary aims of his research project are as follows:\n- To investigate the stimulation-induced network propagation and connectivity patterns in the human brain. He hopes to achieve a better understanding of this using brain stimulation techniques like TMS and multimodal brain imaging techniques such as structural MRI, fMRI, DTI, and EEG.\n- To study how individual variability in brain geometry affects responses to brain stimulation, and how this information can inform neuro-navigation techniques to improve the identification of potential TMS targets.\nTrivia about Shreyas:\nShreyas claims to be the \u0026lsquo;funny\u0026rsquo; one. No one else sees it. Shreyas\u0026rsquo; favourite cuisines include Indian, Mexican, Arabic and Italian. He is the unofficial social director for the students at the lab and while no one really appointed him, they like the fact that he tries to bring people together. Shreyas leads an active lifestyle. He plays football (soccer), swims and enjoys biking (even in the winter!) within the city and on natural trails. Shreyas is an avid chess player and enjoys playing blitz and bullet chess.\nSorenza Bastiaens Ph.D. Student\n Research Interests:\nSorenza officially joined the lab in January, 2021. She completed her M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London, with a final year project at the Neural Coding department. She first worked with Dr. John Griffiths during Google Summer of Code 2020 where she developed a python package for running validation tests on models generating a neural power spectrum. Sorenza\u0026rsquo;s research in the lab is focused on mathematical modelling of large-scale brain network dynamics, with a focus on measured alpha oscillations observed in EEG. The aim of her project is to use and extend these computational models to better understand the role of brain rhythms in large-scale brain networks. She is also interested in understanding how brain stimulation affects these networks, which is crucial to finding treatments for neurological diseases. Sorenza is currently applying her skills in computational neuroscience, neuroimaging and signal processing to compare and analyze different cortico-cortical and corticothalamic models such as the Jansen-Rit, Wilson-Cowan and Robinson models.\nTrivia about Sorenza:\nSorenza is the \u0026lsquo;sporty\u0026rsquo; one. She is always down for pretty much any physical activity and particularly loves to play football (aka soccer), tennis, and loves to go running and hiking. She claims to have a mild coffee dependency. Her day has to start with a cup of coffee, it is non-negotiable apparently. The rest of her day involves some form of working out and meditation routine, followed by a session of reading. Sorenza is no stranger to the world of video games and enjoys playing action-adventure and battle royale games. She is a huge fan of Harry Potter (#Gryffindor) and sci-fi shows. Her secret talent is juggling and bad singing.\nKevin Kadak Ph.D. Student\n Research Interests:\nKevin is a Ph.D. student who joined the lab in September, 2020. His research focuses on modelling synaptic plasticity dynamics in the brain to better optimize TMS stimulation parameters for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Within the theories of calcium-dependent plasticity and metaplasticity, he will be expanding current synaptic simulation models to encompass E-fields estimates, white matter connectivity, cortical geometry, and corticothalamic oscillations to project patient-specific stimulation protocols. This may aid in more robust, long-term neural rewiring and treatment. Both structural and functional imaging techniques, including fMRI and EEG, will be utilized to inform these models.\nHe looks forward to leveraging his previous experience in modelling zebrafish decision patterns towards further refining his computational skillset and, most ideally, constructing novel frameworks for applied clinical use.\nTrivia about Kevin:\nWhen the world isn’t collapsing in on itself, Kevin enjoys Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, thrift shopping, bothering others with puns, and practicing guitar despite never actually managing to improve at it. Kevin is a firm believer in carbonated water, pineapple on pizza (DO NOT put him on a group project with Davide!), and cutting sandwiches diagonally. He also spends his spare time convincing the world that Sky High (2005) is a cinematic masterpiece. When not involved with one of these activities, Kevin is probably squinting at code documentation, confused.\nTaha Morshedzadeh M.Sc. Student\n Research Interests:\nTaha initially joined the lab as an undergraduate research student in January 2021. He started his M.Sc. here in September 2021. He is working on data aquired from market-available electroencephalography headsets such as Muse S, and will be fitting thalamocortical neural field models to this data.\nHe studied Dentistry in Iran for 3 years before dropping out in 2016 to do Neuroscience in Canada. During this time in Iran, he worked with Prof. Mohammad Nami on EEG data. He completed his BSc in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto in 2020. His undergraduate supervisor was Dr. Milad Lankarany with whom he worked on modelling basal ganglia neurons in Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s Disease. He also co-leads NeurotechUofT (neurotechuoft.com), a NeuroTechX student club working on open-source BCI projects.\nTrivia about Taha:\nTaha enjoys running in the hills of Toronto suburbs and city biking. You can always find him up to some shenanigans on Strava. He also redecorates his home almost every two weeks. He says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to see a therapist about this and promises that he\u0026rsquo;s good. Taha enjoys listening to and singing Persian traditional music and is trying to get into composing as well! Taha would like to use this tribune to support Davide in his fight against all evil (i.e., pineapple pizza).\nParsa Oveisi M.A.Sc. Student\n Research Interests:\nParsa joined Grifflab in September 2021 as an undergraduate research student. Parsa’s overarching interest in learning about new frameworks in which the functioning of the brain can be described. Currently, Parsa is working on data acquisition of concurrent EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings using the Kernel Flow ™ headset. He is then using this data, as well as other EEG and fMRI/fNIRS datasets, to develop a deep learning-based whole brain model that can be fitted to individual brains. The model can then be used to predict empirical EEG and hemodynamic responses, as well as shedding light on how patterns from these different modalities arise and interact. Parsa officially joined the lab as a Master\u0026rsquo;s student in September 2022.\nTrivia about Parsa:\nParsa has a spur-of-the-moment attitude in picking up new hobbies and sports. Sources say he picked up archery by fantasizing about being a steppe horse archer of old, though it cannot be confirmed. You will usually find him at his desk (yes, his. So don’t book it!) taking advantage of the extra monitor. If you look closely, however, you will find that where he actually is, is in a state of utter confusion. The keyboard might be being pressed but no actual progress is being made. If you ever need to talk to him, just follow the scent of black tea, or alternatively, start criticizing Lord of the Rings. He will find you.\nAndrew Clappison M.Sc. Student\n Research Interests:\nAndrew joined the WBMG in September 2021, as a graduate student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. Previously, he had completed a Bachelor of Mathematics degree at the University of Waterloo with minors in Computational Mathematics and Cognitive Science. Andrew is interested in discovering how the brain works, particularly how it produces consciousness. During his time in the lab, he will be working with multimodal whole brain models and using machine learning to fit them to concurrent resting-state EEG and fMRI/fNIRS datasets. In doing so, he will try to reproduce and explain phenomena observed in neuroimaging studies such as the Alpha Power - BOLD anticorrelation.\nLab Alumni Minarose Ismail Summer research student\n Minoarose was a summer research student during the summer of 2019. She was a first year undergraduate student at McMaster pursuing a bachelor in Neuroscience with a background in Python coding. Her work was in the field of computational neuroscience and her project dealt with fitting oscillations and one over frequency on MEG data using the FOOOF toolbox to parametrize the power spectra and perform summary analysis.\nSurya Pandiaraju Co-op Student\n Research Interests:\nSurya is a biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo. He is co-supervised by Dr. Andreea Diaconescu. He is interested in EEG data analysis and brain-computer interfaces and their applications in both clinical and consumer-based settings. Currently, he is working on a project focused on designing a pipeline for clinically obtained EEG data that would generate first-level and second-level statistical analyses and is doing so by modifying currently existing tools in MATLAB.\nTrivia:\nSurya enjoys partaking in a number of hobbies including but not limited to drawing (even when he is not supposed to be), digital arts, collectible card games, video games, anime \u0026amp; manga, working out, exploring new restaurants, singing/whistling/beatboxing/humming in the car whilst pretending no one can hear him, and is trying to get his hand in producing after compulsively purchasing a mini MIDI keyboard after watching a video or two on his YouTube recommended list at 12am. If Surya could have any superpower, it would be universal time-control, which he could use to get back the time he spent trying to make this funny.\nDr. Neda Kaboodvand Post-Doctoral Fellow\n Research Interests:\nNeda completed her Ph.D. at the department of clinical neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. In addition, she has master’s in biomedical engineering from Tehran Polytechnic (aka Amirkabir University of Technology), Tehran, Iran. Neda has a strong analytical and computational background, with a growing passion for applying quantitative problem solving and innovative data analysis for solving tangible real-world problems. She has experience in modeling healthy and diseased brains, linear/non-linear time-series and neuroimaging data analysis, statistical and computational modeling of the data, network science and machine learning. She enjoys working in dynamic cross-functional teams on challenging tasks, with measurable real-world outcomes. She joined the lab in July, 2020. She is currently working on whole-brain modelling as well as the analysis and modelling of TMS-evoked responses. The primary aim of her project is to undertake key computational and experimental groundwork for the development and iterative improvement of a novel computational tool for predicting TMS responses and induced plasticity effects. Her long-term aim is to develop computational models of repetitive TMS responses that can be used by clinicians and researchers for optimal patient-specific design of brain stimulation therapies.\nFrank Mazza M.Sc. Student\n Research Interests:\nFrank is a M.Sc. student who joined the lab in September, 2019. He is co-supervised by Dr. Etay Hay (https://www.haybrainlab.com/). Frank is interested in identifying electrophysiological signals for diagnosis of depression and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols for treatment of depression, using computer simulations of detailed brain circuits and whole-brain networks. With previous work in identifying EEG correlates of response in a novel rTMS stimulation paradigm (OFC-rTMS), he now focuses on identifying biomarkers in brain signals for diagnosis of depression by linking cellular, circuit, and connectivity changes to signals relevant for clinical diagnosis. In addition, he is working to optimize TMS protocols using computer simulations at the local and global brain scales by simulating protocol effects on local circuits, such as circuit inhibition, and the propagation of activity to other regions in the brain.\nTrivia about Frank:\nFrank \u0026lsquo;The Grank\u0026rsquo; Mazza. Frank is quite and likes to go about his business, often finishing his work before deadlines, be it grants, abstracts, or manuscripts. Frank does intermittent fasting. No one knows why. Frank likes to read and write about all things art and architecture. He likes to paint, ink, sketch, sculpt and lino-print. Frank has a humble garden where he likes to experiment with growing different plants.
